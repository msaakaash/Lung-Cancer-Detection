# 🫁Lung Cancer Prediction using CNN

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting lung cancer by classifying normal and cancerous lung tissues. Using deep learning, we can automate cancer detection, which traditionally requires expert radiologists.

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, and the model is built using Python with frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🔄 Project Workflow
The following steps are followed in this project:

1. **Importing Libraries & Dataset** 📥
   - Download the dataset
   - Load necessary Python libraries.  
   - Import the dataset. 

3. **Data Visualization** 📊  
   - Analyze sample images from the dataset.  
   - Identify variations in cancerous vs. non-cancerous tissues.  

4. **Image Data Processing** 🖼️  
   - Apply image preprocessing techniques.  
   - Normalize and resize images for CNN training.  

5. **Model Development** 🏗️  
   - Design a simple CNN architecture:  
     - 3 Convolutional layers with Max Pooling  
     - 2 Fully Connected layers  
     - Output layer with Softmax activation  

6. **Model Evaluation** 📈  
   - Visualize loss & accuracy per epoch.  
   - Generate a confusion matrix and classification report.
